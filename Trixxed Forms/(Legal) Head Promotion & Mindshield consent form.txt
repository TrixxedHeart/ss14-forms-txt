The Candidate understands that the [bold]MindShield Implant[/bold] is a mandatory condition of employment for all Command Roles, as stipulated in CCMD-001, Section 2.1.

[head=3]ARTICLE II: CONFIDENTIALITY & NON-DISCLOSURE UNDERTAKING[/head]
The Candidate hereby affirms a lifelong undertaking of confidentiality regarding all Confidential Information. The Candidate shall [bolditalic]not,[/bolditalic] under any circumstances, divulge, disseminate, or communicate Confidential Information to any personnel without Command-level clearance [bold]except in a dire, station-threatening emergency where such disclosure is deemed absolutely necessary for the immediate preservation of Nanotrasen assets and human life, and only to the minimum extent required.[/bold] This undertaking survives termination of employment.

[head=3]ARTICLE III: ASSUMPTION OF RISK & WAIVER OF LIABILITY[/head]
The Candidate acknowledges being informed of the potential risks associated with the Mindshield implantation procedure. While the procedure is classified as [italic]"Minimally Invasive"[/italic] by Nanotrasen Medical Division, understood risks include, but are not limited to: cephalalgia (headache), transient nausea, and in <0.01% of cases, aversion to snakes. The Candidate voluntarily assumes all known and unknown risks associated with the procedure and hereby releases, indemnifies, and holds harmless Nanotrasen, its officers, and employees from any and all liability, claims, and actions arising therefrom.

[head=3]ARTICLE IV: ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF CONSEQUENCES[/head]
The Candidate understands that any attempt to remove, circumvent, tamper with, or willfully damage the Mind Shield implant, or any violation of the confidentiality and conduct policies outlined herein, will result in [color=Red]immediate demotion, termination of employment, revocation of pension benefits, and will subject the Candidate to severe legal action under the Nanotrasen Corporate Judicial Code, including potential charges of treason and espionage.[/color]
